*** Risks

We have now entered Stage 3 of GCC development, and all of the patches we needed to get upstreamed have been upstreamed. The risk present in this table is no longer present.

All the key risks have been addressed, this is just about getting as many features implemented as possible

| Risk                                          | Impact (1-3) | Likelihood (0-10) | Risk (I * L) | Mitigation                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------+--------------+-------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing features for GCC 15.1 deadline        |            2 |                 0 |            0 | Start working on required features as early as July (6mo ahead) |

** Planned Activities
